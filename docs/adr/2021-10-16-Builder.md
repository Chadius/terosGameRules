# Why
The user shouldn't know about implementation details.
Tests are bloated with too much setup details. Too many tests break when implementation details change.

# What is it
Now using Builders to make Powers, Attacks, Heals, Critical Effects, and Squaddies.

# What can we do now?
- Tests are simplified and only specify the required changes.
- Prepare to remove datastream ingestion from classes directly. Let the Builder handle that. 

# Caveats that will trigger future change
- The Builder pattern is its own class, it may require its own maintenance.
- Any time I add a new feature to Squaddie it will have to add a new builder idea.
