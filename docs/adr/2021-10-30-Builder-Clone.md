# Why
It's an easier way to clone powers, squaddies and other objects.
Generates read only objects instead of modifying the existing object

# What does it look like
Add a CloneOf function that makes a new object with everything but the ID the same.

# What is next
Update tests so they use the builder.
Update repositories so they use the builder.
