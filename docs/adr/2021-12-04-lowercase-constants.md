# All constants should be lower case
Squaddie Affiliation was capitalized (Player instead of player).
When making YAML and JSON, the affiliation is inconsistent with other constants, like movement type.

Make everything lower case now. While this is an extra requirement for this task, this is public facing.
Need to reduce the amount of times the public API needs to be changed- may as well consolidate them now.
